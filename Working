The basic functioning of this website is to display the message typed in the “your message” textbox and also display the image
from URL of any legit image address written in the “message image” box.

Now to perform XSS, we try to insert a <script> tag in the “your message” box.

The browser identifies the <script> tag and blocks it from getting executed, hence the tag gets printed as it is on the screen.

Now to find a loophole in this website for our <script> to work we inspect the code and found the HTML <image> tag.

To insert an image:
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">

This is how the html image tag works.
Now what we’ll do is put an image URL in the “message images” section and then close the sentence with 
an colon (“), which will made browser think that the src part of the <img> tag is done and closed, hence 
it’ll start executing whatever command we type after it. Even if the commands functioning is something which 
is not the expected outcome of the website when the developers made it.

As we can see in the output screen the script ran inside the “message image” box and generated an alert message.
THIS MESSAGE WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR OUR WEBSITE AS IT ISN’T SUPPOSED TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN SHOWING 
THE MESSAGE AND IT’S IMAGE.
