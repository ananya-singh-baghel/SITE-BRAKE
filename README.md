# SITE-BRAKE
Cross Site Scripting using CyberSecurity principles

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It enables an attacker to get around the same origin policy, which is intended to keep various websites separate from one another. Cross-site scripting flaws typically give an attacker the ability to pretend to be a victim user, execute any operations they are capable of performing, and access any of the user's data.

This project's main goal is:

OBJECTIVE

● To investigate the various procedures involved in cross-site scripting website hacking

● to show the procedure for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications

● to obtain access to and communicate with a target server or application

● should become aware of how such attacks function in order to learn how
to defend against them.
